      It was great to hear that they thought the cake was just as good after their last bite as they
      thought it was with their first.The cake batter really can be made in a bowl without the use
      of a heavy duty mixer.

      <ol>
        <li>
          Preheat oven to 350ยบ F. Prepare two 9-inch cake pans by spraying with baking spray or
          buttering and lightly flouring.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add flour, sugar, cocoa, baking powder, baking soda, salt and espresso powder to a large
          bowl or the bowl of a stand mixer. Whisk through to combine or, using your paddle
          attachment, stir through flour mixture until combined well.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add milk, vegetable oil, eggs, and vanilla to flour mixture and mix together on medium
          speed until well combined. Reduce speed and carefully add boiling water to the cake batter
          until well combined.
        </li>
        <li>
          Distribute cake batter evenly between the two prepared cake pans. Bake for 30-35 minutes,
          until a toothpick or cake tester inserted in the center of the chocolate cake comes out
          clean.
        </li>
        <li>
          Remove from the oven and allow to cool for about 10 minutes, remove from the pan and cool
          completely.
